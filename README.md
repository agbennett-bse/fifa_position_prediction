## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is predict the position of a futbol player based on a set of physical attributes and skills. 

### Methods Used
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Multi-class Classification

## Project Description
In this project, we conducted extensive exploratory analysis, which helps to understand the data for each position. Then, we create a classification to predict whether the player is forward, defense or midfield. Then we predict which type of position the player is in within the forward, defense or midfield class. Finally, we predict which side of the field the player will play on.
